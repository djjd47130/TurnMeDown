<H1>  Turn Me  Down</H1>
<P><EM>by Jerry Dodge</EM>  </P>
<P>Turn Me Down is a tool to automatically control the 
system volume at certain hours of the day. Its inspiration is to prevent angry apartment neighbors from pounding on your door at 1am. 
You assign your quiet hours, and the application will do the rest - forcing 
the volume to a low level throughout certain hours.</P>
<H2>Basic Function</H2>
<P>The application runs in your desktop background, with an icon in the notification tray. You 
choose your quiet hours, and the maximum system volume for that time, and the 
application automatically respects those options. If the current time falls with 
any scheduled "quiet hours", it forcibly changes the system volume down to the 
selected max volume. If user attempts to raise volume, it will not allow them. However, a 
snooze feature is proposed which would allow a period of time to override it, 
without having to disable it.</P>

    Interface</H2>
<P>The user interface of Turn Me Down is meant to be as 
simple as possible</P>
<P><IMG alt="" src="Img/MainForm.png" > </P>
<P>There are only a handful of options:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <DIV><STRONG>Active</STRONG> -&nbsp;A 
  switch to toggle the rules on and off.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV><STRONG>Quiet Time Start</STRONG> 
  - A time picker to select the time of day to begin volume rules.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV><STRONG>Quiet Time Stop</STRONG> 
  - A time picker to select the time of day to end volume rules.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV><STRONG>Max Volume</STRONG> - The 
  maximum allowed volume during selected quiet hours.</DIV></LI></UL>
<P>Note that when you hover your mouse pointer over any of 
these controls, it shows a hint text at the bottom of the window.</P>
